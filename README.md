## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup
1. Create a virtual environment using [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/):   
   ```bash
      conda create -n streaming python=3.10
      conda activate streaming
   ```

2. Install dependencies:   
   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt   
      cd backend
   ```

3. Run backend app:   
   ```bash
      python app.py  
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Install dependencies:   
   ```bash
      cd .. # back to the root folder (streaming-packages)
      cd frontend
      npm install   
   ```

2. Start development server:   
   ```bash
      npm start 
   ```

## Overview

This application solves the complex problem of finding the most cost-effective streaming package combinations by:
1. Analyzing team schedules and broadcast rights
2. Comparing streaming service offerings
3. Calculating optimal package combinations
4. Presenting personalized recommendations

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React.js with TypeScript for type safety
- Redux for state management
- Material-UI for responsive design
- React Query for efficient data fetching

### Backend
- Python FastAPI for high-performance REST API
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- Celery for background task processing

## Core Algorithm

The package recommendation engine uses a dynamic programming approach to solve the "Set Cover" problem:

1. **Data Collection**
   - Team schedules from sports league APIs
   - Streaming service offerings and blackout rules
   - Real-time pricing data

2. **Optimization Process**
   - Builds a coverage matrix (Games Ã— Packages)
   - Uses weighted set cover algorithm to minimize cost
   - Considers regional blackouts and local availability

3. **Result Generation**
   - Ranks package combinations by:
     - Total cost
     - Coverage percentage
     - Number of required subscriptions

## Performance Optimizations

### Implemented
- Redis caching for frequently requested team combinations
- Batch processing for multiple team analyses
- Precomputed coverage matrices for popular teams
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields

### Future Optimizations
1. **Algorithm Improvements**
   - Parallel processing for large team sets
   - Progressive loading of recommendations
   - Machine learning for personalized rankings

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Geographic-based cache partitioning
   - Predictive caching during peak seasons
   - Cache warming for trending teams

3. **Infrastructure**
   - CDN integration for static assets
   - Regional API deployment
   - Horizontal scaling during high-traffic periods
